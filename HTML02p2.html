                    <hr>

                    <p>The Seven Archons, typically shortened to The Seven, are the six gods and one human who preside over the seven regions of Teyvat, established after they or their predecessors emerged as the victors of the Archon War 2,000 years ago. Each Archon is associated with an element and an ideal, by which they formed their territories' environment and determined their method of governance over their regions.
                    Each Archon possesses a magic focus called a Gnosis, which allows them to resonate directly with Celestia. By comparison, Visions are "primitive" â€” though a Gnosis's capabilities and purpose, beyond acting as a symbol of an Archon's status, remain unknown. Each Archon is bound to a Divine Throne, which is composed of a portion of the authority of one of the Seven Sovereigns, and which grants them authority over the corresponding element.
                        
                    As of Archon Quest Chapter IV: Act V - Masquerade of the Guilty, only six Divine Thrones remain. The Hydro Archon's Divine Throne was destroyed, returning the authority within to the Hydro Dragon Sovereign and breaking the established order of the Seven.</p>
