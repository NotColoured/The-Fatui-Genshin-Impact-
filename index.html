                    <hr>

                    <p>The Fatui (Fatuus for a singular member), also known as Diplomats of Zapolyarny Palace and Diplomats of Snezhnaya, are a corrupt and malicious delegation of "diplomats" are one of the two main antagonists (alongside the Abyss Order) in the "Genshin Impact". hailing from the Zapolyarny Palace in Snezhnaya under the command of the Tsaritsa of Snezhnaya. They are led by the Eleven Fatui Harbingers, they are one of the most constant threats to the Traveler and to the entire world of Teyvat.
                    They, unlike the Abyss Order, are an organization composed of and controlled by humans. They are also more well-organized economically, militarily and politically. The Eleven Fatui Harbingers, who each control a certain division inside of the Fatui to fulfil their mysterious and sinister missions given by the Tsaritsa, are scattered across all of the Teyvat continent. They use conspiracy movements to infiltrate the nations' governments so they can plant their seeds of corruption in an attempt to control the affairs of all seven nations.</p>

                    <p>The Fatui are described as an overwhelming military force in terms of power and numbers that make Snezhnaya the strongest of all the seven nations in Teyvat. They are widely distrusted, feared, and despised by the other nations. The organization is mostly composed of combatants instead of politicians and merchants for an organization who proudly call themselves "diplomats."The Fatui are publicly seen as a political department that represent the good will of the Tsaritsa and manage foreign affairs with all other six nations, often using economical means and fair trade movements to first engage with other governments in order to safely assert their influence inside the nations' center of power. Once they have near full control of the government and capital, the Fatui cease being a friendly and diplomatic group and start using corrupt and violent means to get what they want, implementing abusive taxes and inhumane demands that will cost the lives of civilians in the process.</p>

                    <p>Despite their public fa√ßade of a benevolent group that seems to engage with merchants and politicians with friendly proposals, their infamy is already too widespread for the Fatui to keep hiding their true colors from the people so they are now widely viewed as a threat to all nations. The Fatui are experts in the field of economics, defense, and policies and will use any modern ways to gain full control of all nations of the world to further the Tsaritsa's "perfect world".Despite their loyalty to their queen, many of the Fatui's underlings are unaware of the Tsaritsa's true plans and no one dares to question her true motives. The only one so far that has come close to know the Tsaritsa's true purposes may be La Signora who is directly in charge of gathering the Gnoses of the other Archons of Teyvat. Despite their good organization, the Fatui are divided into groups that are each headed by one of the Eleven Fatui Harbingers. The groups don't have any contact or relations with each other once said groups isolate themselves in different regions of Teyvat to complete their tasks.</p>

                    <p>While the Fatui are widely distrusted, hated and feared by the people of Teyvat, in-game it's presented that many grunts are actually normal workers (all of them being from the staff teams) and are unaware of their superiors' true intentions. Moreover, when said underlings try to be presented as "evil" they ultimately fail to even become a suspicious enemy. The Fatui seem to be the group controlling the Northland Bank, a national bank founded in Snezhnaya. They opened a bank in Liyue and became the favorite bank of Teyvat due to their openly illegal activities. As a neutral department, the Fatui often uses the bank as a mask to cover their operations and will more likely use the branch as their center of intelligence to command their operations across the region.</p>
